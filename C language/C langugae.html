                C is a general-purpose, procedural, high-level programming language used in the development of computer software and applications, system programming, games, web development, and more.
           
                C language was developed by Dennis M. Ritchie at the Bell Telephone Laboratories in 1972.
                It is a powerful and flexible language which was first developed for the programming of the UNIX operating System.
                C is one of the most widely used programming languages.
                C programming language is known for its simplicity and efficiency. It is the best choice to start with programming as it gives you a foundational understanding of programming.<br><br>

<hr><b>C Language Overview:</b><br><hr><br>

C is a versatile and influential programming language that originated at Bell Labs in the early 1970s. Developed by Dennis Ritchie, C became the precursor to many modern programming languages and played a pivotal role in the development of the Unix operating system. Known for its efficiency and low-level programming capabilities, C is widely used in system programming, embedded systems, and application development.
<br><br>
<hr><b>Data Types in C:</b><br><hr><br>

C offers a set of fundamental data types, including int for integers, float and double for floating-point numbers, char for characters, and more. These data types enable the storage and manipulation of different kinds of values in a C program. Additionally, C supports the creation of user-defined data types through structures, unions, and enumerations, providing flexibility for organizing and representing complex data.

<br><br><hr><b>Data Structures in C:</b><br><hr><br>

C allows the implementation of various data structures, crucial for solving complex problems efficiently. Arrays provide a way to store collections of elements, and strings are essentially arrays of characters. C supports structures to group different data types under a single name, unions to share memory space between different types, and pointers for dynamic memory allocation. The language's support for low-level manipulation allows the creation of linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and other essential data structures.

<br><br><hr><b>History of C:</b><br><hr><br>

C has a rich history, evolving from earlier programming languages like B and BCPL. Its development by Dennis Ritchie and Ken Thompson at Bell Labs aimed at creating a language suitable for system programming on the emerging Unix operating system. Over time, C gained popularity for its portability, efficiency, and simplicity, leading to its standardization by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) as ANSI C in 1989. The language has since influenced the design of many other languages and continues to be widely used, remaining a foundational skill for programmers across diverse domains.
